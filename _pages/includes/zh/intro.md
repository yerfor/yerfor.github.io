I am a third-year CS Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also got my Bs.s from the school of aerospace and astronautics, Zhejiang University. I won the National Scholarship in 2021.

My current research interests include Text-to-Speech (TTS) and 3D Talking Face Generation. I have also deeply investigated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). I have published 10 papers in high-impact conference/journals, including IJCAI and IEEE TMC.
