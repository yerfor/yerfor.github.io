I am a fourth-year CS Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I won the National Scholarship in 2021.

My current research interests include 3D Talking Face Generation and Text-to-Speech (TTS). I have also deeply investigated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). I have published 10+ papers in high-impact conference/journals, including ICLR, IJCAI, ACL, IEEE TMC, etc.
