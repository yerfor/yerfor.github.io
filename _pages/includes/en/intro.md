I'm currently working on Diffusion-based Large Avatar Model. I got my Ph.D. at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). My acedamic experience include 3D Talking Face Generation and Text-to-Speech (TTS). I have also deeply investigated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). I have published 15+ papers in high-impact conference/journals, including ICLR, IJCAI, ACL, IEEE TMC, etc.
