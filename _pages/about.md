I am a second-year CS Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Zhou Zhao (èµµæ´²)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also got my Bs.s from  school of aerospace and astronautics, Zhejiang University with a bachelor's degree. I won the National Scholarship in 2021.

My current research interests include Text-to-Speech (TTS) and 3D Talking Face Synthesis. I have also deeply investigated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). I have published 9 papers in high-impact conference/journals, including IJCAI and IEEE TMC.
