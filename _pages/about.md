I am a second-year CS Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Zhou Zhao (ËµµÊ¥≤)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also got my Bs.s from the school of aerospace and astronautics, Zhejiang University with a bachelor's degree. I won the National Scholarship in 2021.

My current research interests include Text-to-Speech (TTS) and 3D Talking Face Synthesis. I have also deeply investigated Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and  Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). I have published 9 papers in high-impact conference/journals, including IJCAI and IEEE TMC.

[**Project**](https://github.com/yerfor/SyntaSpeech) [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yerfor/SyntaSpeech?style=social)](https://github.com/yerfor/SyntaSpeech)

- SyntaSpeech is the first syntax-aware non-autoregressive speech synthesis model.
- We design a syntax graph to extract information from input text for better prosody.
